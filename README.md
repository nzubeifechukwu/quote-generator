# Quote Generator

Quote generator is a web app that generates a new quote on button click. There is also a tweet button for sharing the quote on Twitter.

The app is [live here](https://nzubeifechukwu-quote-generator.netlify.app/).

## Installation

Quote generator is a React app. To install and run it locally, clone the repo and run:

```
cd quote-generator
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Inspiration

The idea for this project was obtained from @freeCodeCamp's [Frontend Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).

## Acknowledgement

For the quotes, I used the [API Ninjas's Quotes API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes).

I'm grateful for this [React 18 course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-crBg6wpp0) by [John Smilga](https://twitter.com/john_smilga).
